# React Native Intermittent Crash Bug
This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent crashes in a React Native application during data fetching. The app fetches data from a remote API and displays it using FlatList.  The crash is non-deterministic and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description
The app randomly crashes without providing a consistent error message. The issue seems related to network requests and how the app handles failures or unexpected responses.  The crash occurs after fetching data using the `useEffect` hook.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
3. Use the app repeatedly.  The crash will occur non-deterministically.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and checking for various failure scenarios during the data fetching process. A better way to manage the state during the loading and error handling is to add more detailed logging for better debugging.
